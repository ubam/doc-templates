So, maybe this is You. Does GitHub seem really intimidating? Do you sometimes go out of your way to avoid coming into contact with GitHub too much? Then this guide is for you.

Or maybe this is not You and Your name is not Wayne and you really don't mind people talking about GitHub but have no clue what to do there other than just following links people post and try to read some of the text that appears. Do not worry, this is aimed at *you*, too!

# Why Use Github?

The first step in being able to use and eventually master github is to understand the 'why' behind it.  In short, Github allows us to have full control over document content while creating these documents in a community environment, which UBports is.  The benefits of 'sticking to the program' (even if it's foreign to you in the beginning) are:

- version control (if someone goofs a document and loses a paragraph, you can see the old version and correct error)
- group collaboration
- standarized text format (it's a simple text environment)
- easier transition to computer programming if/when you ever decide to start writing code - after all, the code that runs Ubuntu Touch lives in Github, too!
- email alerts when changes happen to documents
- and more
