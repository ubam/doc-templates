So, maybe this is You. GitHub seems really intimidating? Do You sometimes go out of other peoples way to avoid coming into contact with GitHub too much? Then this guide is for You.

Or maybe this is not You and Your name is not Wayne and You really don't mind people talking about GitHub but have no clue what to do there other than just following links people post and try to read some of the text that appears. Do not worry, this is aimed at *You*, too!
